# 👑 Founders

## Who

Founder Members are the early visionaries who hold special Zo World [Founder NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/founders-of-zo-world), \
symbolising their pivotal role in shaping Zo World. They come from diverse backgrounds—entrepreneurs, VCs, developers, artists, and cultural catalysts—but share a common drive to follow their hearts and co-create the future of onchain culture.

## What

Founder Members are the cornerstone of the Zo network. They:

• Set the Tone: Provide leadership by moulding Zo’s protocol collaboration, openness, and creativity.

• Mentor Newcomers: Guide Citizens and potential Founders, helping them integrate into the Zo community.

• Launch Nodes & Zo Houses: Pioneer IRL spaces (Flo Zones, Party Nodes, Stay Nodes, Zo Houses) that become cultural hubs for everyone.

• Shape Governance & Strategy: Contribute to decision-making on everything from token economics to community guidelines.

## Why

Cultural Stewardship: Founder Members protect and propagate Zo’s core values, ensuring that “Follow Your Heart” remains at the centre of every project, city, or node.

Network Growth: By uniting talented, passionate individuals, Founder Members expand Zo’s influence, forging real-world communities and digital collaborations alike.

Value Creation: Holding Founder NFTs is more than a title—it’s an active investment in Zo World’s success. Founder Members receive early access to new nodes, events, and potential $Zo mining opportunities.

Collective Consciousness: Founder Members believe in building a collective consciousness that fosters innovation, mutual support, and cultural breakthroughs—all anchored in an onchain ethos.
