# How to Party

**Life Cycle of an Event**&#x20;

1\. Lead Management

* Send the [event proposal form](https://tally.so/r/mOYj6k) to the lead ~~(internal or external)~~.
* An automated notification of the form response will be shared on the city Discord channel via Zapier.
* Notify the specific city node.
* &#x20;Review responses for quality and economics.

2\. Preproduction

* Create a telegram group with the city team.
* Finalize event details: date, time, deliverables, and commercials.
* Once finalized, event confirmation is done when:
  * For inbound events:
    * the contract is signed.
    * the invoice is shared.
    * An advance payment of 50% is processed.
  * For ~~self-sponsored~~ events:
    * the budget is approved
* Set up RSVP link on Luma or any RSVP platform and design creatives.
* Add the event to the city events calendar.
* Announcement across all channels (X, TG, Discord, personal invites).
*   Share confirmation in the city channel in the following format:

    EVENT CONFIRMATION: \
    Name\
    Date & time\
    no. of people\
    RSVP link\
    FnB requirements (along with finalized menu)\
    Screens, if any\
    Audio Visual requirements\
    notes/additional details

3\. Event Production

* Pre-event:&#x20;
  * Finalize FnB with the venue
  * onboard vendors, if required
  * logistics - setups (Bar, Presentation, Console, Live Stream, Gaming, etc)
* During event:&#x20;
  * Manage & test setups to ensure smooth operations
  * Live updates on the city tg group, discord channel & twitter (X)
* Post-event:&#x20;
  * Restore setups back to default
  * ensure all visitors have left the premises

4\. Postproduction

* Collate the event content on a central drive (insert link)
* Share the content with the VP team, if required
* Social media updates of the event (twitter & instagram)
* Settle payments with vendors and clients.
* Update all data on the city's master event db.

This streamlined format ensures a consistent and efficient event workflow.
