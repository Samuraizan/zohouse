# 🐦 Twitter Playbook

Step 1: Launch with a First Tweet

• Action:

Draft a short, impactful message announcing your city’s arrival into the Zo network.

• Example:

_“Zo Zo Zo \[City]! We’re bringing onchain culture, creativity, and $Zo to our hometown. Say ‘Zo Zo Zo’ to join us, and let’s build something extraordinary together.”_

• Impact:

This is your public debut—showing that you’re part of a global movement. A confident, inviting tweet can attract initial followers and pique interest.\


Step 2: Update Your PFP for Instant Identity

• Action:

Change your Twitter profile picture to something that visually represents your city’s Zo vibe—maybe an emblem that fuses local flair with Zo’s aesthetic.

• Why This Matters:

A distinctive PFP helps followers recognize you instantly as they scroll. You’re establishing an identifiable brand, making it easier for newcomers to trust and join your journey.\


Step 3: Start Dropping Alpha

• Action:

After your first tweet and PFP update, begin teasing upcoming activities, events, or $Zo opportunities. Keep it cryptic and exciting.

• Examples:

_“Who’s ready for our first secret meetup? Keep your $Zo handy!”_

_“Early birds, watch this space—something is about to spark next week.”_

• Goal:

Inspire curiosity. Make people lean in and wonder what’s next, encouraging them to stay connected and spread the word.\


At this point, you’ve got the city’s initial attention. A strong first impression, a memorable visual identity, and some tasty alpha go a long way in setting the stage. Now it’s time to get serious about the long-term vision.
