# 3️ Level 3: Contribution

At **Level 3**, players actively **contribute to the vibe network** through **community-led operations** and **establishing Zo Nodes.** This is the **only way to mine $Zo tokens outside of Zo Houses**, making contribution an integral part of sustaining and expanding the Zo network. Players become **catalysts for growth**, onboarding new users, and amplifying the cultural and economic impact of the ecosystem.

**Key Focus:**

Empowering players to build and expand the Zo ecosystem by hosting activities, creating decentralised hubs, and fostering community engagement.

*   **Spaces**

    **Zo Houses** → Community Led Ops.

    **Nodes (Co-Work, Stay, Party Nodes)** → Earning $Zo through decentralised physical hubs
* **Key Elements**
  *   **Hosting Community Events (Schelling Point)**

      **Action:** Players organise and lead events like hackathons, cultural festivals, and onboarding workshops.

      **Onchain Effect:** Events are ticketed through $Zo, and participation fees contribute to mining tokens for the event organisers.
  *   **Volunteering for Operations (Flo Zone)**

      **Action:** Players take on roles in managing co-working spaces, mentoring new users, or facilitating workshops.

      **Effect:** Contributions are logged onchain, and participants earn $Zo tokens for their time and efforts.
  *   **Establishing Zo Nodes**

      **Action:** Founder members transform their properties into decentralised hubs (Co-Work, Stay, or Party Nodes) to serve as focal points for the Zo ecosystem.

      **Onchain Effect:** All node transactions—like bookings, memberships, or event tickets—generate $Zo tokens for the node owners, creating local hubs of activity.
  *   **Amplifying Zo Content (Zo Studio)**

      **Action:** Players create promotional materials, tutorials, or cultural content that onboard users and promote the Zo ethos.

      **Effect:** Content milestones are rewarded with $Zo tokens, tracked and logged via dynamic NFTs.
  *   **Cultural Challenges and Quests (Nodes)**

      **Action:** Players and communities participate in localised quests and themed challenges hosted by nodes, encouraging interaction and engagement.

      **Onchain Effect:** Activities are logged, with participants and node owners earning $Zo tokens for their involvement.
  *   **Incentives for Contribution**

      **Node Activation Rewards:** Founder members earn $Zo tokens for successfully registering and activating a Zo Node.

      **Transaction-Based Mining:** A percentage of $Zo transactions within nodes is distributed as mining rewards for contributors.

      **Tiered Engagement Rewards:** Highly active nodes or impactful events earn additional $Zo incentives.
