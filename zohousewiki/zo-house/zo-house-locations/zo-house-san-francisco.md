## FAQs

<details>

<summary>1. How to Unlock the House?</summary>

Question: How do guests and residents unlock the house?

\
Answer: Founder Members of Zo World can use the /unlock command in the Telegram live group to open the door, leveraging a secure Web3-integrated system. Visitors must be invited by a Founder Member or have a confirmed booking to access the house, with no other entry methods permitted. A visitor form, provided as part of the pre-check-in message, must be completed and is shareable by bookers with their visitors.

Process for Founder Members:

* Join the Zo House Telegram live group (accessible via the Zo App or an invite link from the House Captain).
* Use the /unlock command, which triggers a smart lock system linked to your verified Zo World Passport (a Base wallet with multi-factor authentication, including email and onchain verification).
* The system confirms Founder NFT ownership before granting access, ensuring security and exclusivity.

Process for Visitors:

* Visitors must either be invited by a Founder Member or have a confirmed booking through the Zo App or zostel.com.
* Upon booking, the primary booker receives a pre-check-in message containing a visitor form as a link.
* The booker can share this form with their visitors, who must complete it with details like name, contact info, and visit purpose.
* Uninvited or non-booked visitors are not permitted beyond the reception area.

Backup: In case of technical issues (e.g., Telegram downtime or app glitches), contact the House Captain via Telegram for manual access. Physical access cards are provided at the location upon verification, requiring a refundable deposit (e.g., 500 INR, returned at check-out).

Security Note: All access is logged onchain for transparency, and physical cards are deactivated post-use to prevent unauthorized entry.
