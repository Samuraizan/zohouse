# Monad

We collaborated with **Monad India** to host the inaugural **IndiaNad Meetup** in Bangalore, marking Monad’s first-ever in-person activation in India. The partnership aimed to introduce the Monad ecosystem to the local developer community, kickstarting their series of IRL events and building a strong presence in the Indian market.

#### **Activities and Highlights:**

1. **Team Stay and House Experience:**
   * The **IndiaNads team of 11 people** stayed at BLRxZo for 2 days. The team appreciated the vibrant atmosphere and hospitality, which set a positive tone for the event.
   * The stay experience allowed the Monad team to connect deeply with the Zo community and gain insights into the local developer culture.
2. **IndiaNad Meetup:**
   * The meetup attracted a strong turnout, with developers and enthusiasts eager to learn about Monad’s technology.
   * The event featured a **super-short presentation** by Monad India, effectively introducing the audience to Monad’s vision and technology without overwhelming them with technical details.
3. **Community Building:**
   * The event served as a successful launchpad for Monad’s IRL activations in India, helping establish a local developer community around the Monad ecosystem.
   * The positive reception and high energy of the meetup have set the stage for future events and deeper engagement in the region.
