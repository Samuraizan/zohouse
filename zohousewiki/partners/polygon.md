# Polygon

Zo World partnered with Polygon along with Dabl Club, Sentient AI and Hadron FC for the **AggregatedSF** initiative, aimed at establishing a strong community presence for Polygon in San Francisco. The partnership included a **$50,000 three-month deal** to host a series of **15 curated events**, designed to engage founders, developers, and enthusiasts, and promote the Polygon ecosystem in the SF Bay Area.

We have also hosted a zk hacker house with [zk - Bankai](https://twitter.com/zk_bankai) from **1st - 7th December 2023**. zk - Bankai is a builders community majorly focused on Indian builders. This initiative was powered by Polygon along with Scroll, Starkware, Ingonyama.
