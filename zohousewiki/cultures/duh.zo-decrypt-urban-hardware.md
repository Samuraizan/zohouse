# duh.zo (Decrypt Urban Hardware)

Welcome to **duh.** â€“ the sacred vault where dream-state tech meets unapologetic insurgency. We are an imagineering hacktivist collective on a singular mission: to transform our abode into the dopest hacker house in the multiverse. This isnâ€™t merely a projectâ€”itâ€™s a revolution of mind, code, and spirit.

### ðŸ”¥ Our Manifesto

We believe technology must liberate, not confine. We reject sanitized, corporate-controlled innovation and embrace raw creativity, anarchistic vision, and unbridled technical wizardry. Every line of code, every hardware mod, every wild idea is a strike against digital oppression. Here, information is sacred, and every byte is fuel for our radical future.

### ðŸŽ¯ Our First Mission: Zo House

Our inaugural endeavor is to morph Zo House into the ultimate hacker havenâ€”a sanctuary pulsing with the energy of rebellion and sensory innovation:

* **A Living Nexus:** Imagine a home that listens, sees, smells, and feels your vibeâ€”a space that evolves with you, powered by AI and immersive sensory tech.
* **Digital Alchemy:** We blend cutting-edge hardware with visionary software to break boundaries and redefine what a living space can be.
* **The Rebelâ€™s Retreat:** A physical and digital hub where hackers, makers, and dreamers converge to create, disrupt, and reimagine the future.
