# üåê Zo World

## What is Zo World?

Zo World is a network state for culture, bridging digital communities and physical spaces. Our core principle‚Äî‚ÄúFollow Your Heart‚Äù‚Äîencourages freedom, creativity, and collaboration. Within Zo World, you‚Äôll find diverse tribes: founders, artists, travellers, devs, gamers, DAOs, and more, all co-creating a global cultural ecosystem powered by onchain tools and real-world experiences.

## Context & Vibes

‚Ä¢ Zo World embodies a vibrant, dynamic spirit that draws people in with its unique energy. While it fosters a strong sense of belonging, its foundation lies in openness, inclusivity, and celebrating individuality.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúZo Zo Zo‚Äù: More than a phrase, it‚Äôs a unifying chant that welcomes participants, sparks conversation, and fuels cultural exchange.

‚Ä¢ Onchain + IRL Fusion: From digital art to tech enabled co-living spaces, we tie Web3 innovations to tangible events and physical environments‚Äîmaking sure culture isn‚Äôt just talked about, but actively lived.

## Governance

Zo World follows a DAO-like approach, so no single entity holds absolute power. Instead:

### 1. Founder Members & Zo HQ

‚Ä¢ Stewards of the Protocol: Refine or amend the rules, tokenomics, and big-picture vision.

‚Ä¢ Thought Leaders: Guide major cultural and strategic initiatives.

### 2. City Guardians

‚Ä¢ Local Governance: The Guardians oversee day-to-day operations within their city, ensuring seamless management of events, finances, and partnerships. They are the regional stewards of Zo‚Äôs ethos, fostering an environment that embodies collaboration, creativity, and inclusivity.

‚Ä¢ Adaptation & Autonomy: Guardians ensure their city aligns with Zo vibes while adapting to local cultural nuances.&#x20;

### 3. Citizens

‚Ä¢ Grassroots Energy: Hold Citizens digital collectibles, attend events, propose ideas, and earn/spend $Zo.

‚Ä¢ Creative Freedom: From hosting art shows to gaming tournaments, Citizens bring Zo vibes _**life**_ on the ground.
